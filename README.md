# MongoDB $in Operator Bug
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries. The `$in` operator expects an array of values, but this example incorrectly provides a single string value, causing the query to return unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code uses the `$in` operator with a single string instead of an array.  This leads to an incorrect query that does not correctly match the user document.

## Solution
The solution involves correcting the query to provide an array of values to the `$in` operator.
